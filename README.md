# TAMUHack-24-Repo
We believe that to persuade a customer, three things need to be fulfilled: the product's What, How, and Why. On the current American Airlines website, attempts to redeem miles are met with locations that you can use your points on. The customer knows what the location is (What is the location we're going to?) and understands that they will get their via air travel (How are we getting there?). But, the customer has to search up themselves what the city they're traveling to has to offer. To make it more convenient, we have designed a web app that shows a list of cities which, after clicking on, shows events that the city has to offer (Why are we going?).
